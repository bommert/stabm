How should the expected value of the stability score (see Details)
be assessed? Options are "estimate", "exact" and "none".
For "estimate", \code{N} random feature sets of the same sizes as the input feature
sets (\code{features}) are generated.
For "exact", all possible combinations of feature sets of the same
sizes as the input feature sets are used. Computation is only feasible for very
small numbers of features and numbers of considered datasets (\code{length(features)}).
For "none", the transformation \eqn{(score - expected) / (maximum - expected)}
is not conducted, i.e. only \eqn{score} is used.
This is not recommended.}

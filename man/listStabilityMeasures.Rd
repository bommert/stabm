\usage{
listStabilityMeasures()
}
\value{
\code{data.frame} \cr
For each stability measure, its name,
the information, whether it is corrected for chance by definition,
the information, whether it is adjusted for similar features,
its minimal value and its maximal value are displayed.
}
\description{
Lists all stability measures of package \emph{stabm} and
provides information about them.
}
\section{Note}{
 The given minimal values might only be reachable
in some scenarios, e.g. if the feature sets have a certain size.
The measures which are not corrected for chance by definition can
be corrected for chance with \code{correction.for.chance}.
This however changes the minimal value.
For the adjusted stability measures, the minimal value depends
on the similarity structure.
